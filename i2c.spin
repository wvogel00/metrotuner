''
'' this object provides the PUBLIC functions:
''  -> Init  - sets up the address and inits sub-objects such
''  -> Stop - stop the object
''  -> Start - start the object
''  -> getError - gets the error flag
''  -> clearError - clear the error
''  -> isStarted - returns true/false for the object started state
''  -> testBus - allows the pullups to raise the bus to pinHIGH's.  Sets errorlevel
''  -> devicePresent - sents and address byte and looks for the device to ACK
''  -> read   - high level READ functions using the four low level functions
''  -> write  - high level WRITE functions using the four low level functions
''  -> i2cStart - performs a bus start
''  -> i2cStop - performs a bus stop
''  -> i2cRead - performs a read
''  -> i2cWrite - performs a write
''
'' this object provides the PRIVATE functions:
''  -> None
''
'' this object uses the following sub OBJECTS:
''  -> None
''
'' Revision History:
''  -> V1 - Release
''      -> V1.1 - Documentation update, slight code tidy-up
''      -> V1.2 - More Documentation update, slight code tidy-up
''                i2cWrite changes - see below.
''      -> V1.3 - additional parameter added to the init to allow for SCL lines that
''                don't have resistor pull-ups. This allows for the Propeller Dev board SCL and SDA pins
''                28/29 if you use them.  Note that if the i2cObject code is set to drive the
''                i2c SCL line - this will not work if more than one cog attempts to run it (obviously)
''                not at the same time!!)  (thanks to Michael Green on the forums)
''                Normally set to FALSE if you have pull-ups, and TRUE if you dont.
''
''                ++ i2cBits parameter removed from the i2cRead function as it was not used!!
''
''      -> V2.0 - Added data size of 16,24,32 bits to read() to allow reading 16,24 and 32 registers                  
''
'' i2c Address's:
''  -> Specify the full 8 bit address when using the high level object, they will add the R/W 1/0 bit in the LSB
''  -> Low level objects - specify it as you want to come out!
''
'' ACK/NAK bit return:
''  -> Implemented to allow the calling application to see the last 32 ack/naks returned in a multi-write operation.
''     For example, if a call makes three (3) writes and produces no errors (acks) you will get a 0 returned.
''     If the middle write is NAK'd by the device, you'll get (in binary) %010 back.  So if you get a >0 back
''     as a return a NAK as occurred somewhere.  Look at it in binary to see which!
'' 
'' Bus Error handing:
''  -> Partially implemented.  When its completed each method can set error flags appropriate to the condition
''  -> External routines can use getError and clear error to access the error states.  Could be expanded to include
''  -> bus arbiration errors in the future.
''    
'' i2cWrite - changed (v1.2)  :  i2cwrite now always outputs the top 8 bits of a the LONG data, i.e.
''      %xxxxxxxx_00000000_00000000_00000000
''     The i2cbits parameter controlls an shift, so if you pass i2cWrite (10, 8) it will shift the low byte left 24 bits
''      %00000000_00000000_00000000_00001010  is shifted to become...
''      %00001010_00000000_00000000_00000000  then the top 8 bits are output!
