' This program (a quick piece of junk) demonstrates the VGA_HIRES_TEXT
' object. It is meant for use on the Propeller Demo Board Rev C. You can
' plug in a mouse for screen action. The mouse driver has been upgraded
' to provided bounded mouse coordinates. This makes constrained and
' scaled mouse movement mindless.

' The VGA_HIRES_TEXT went through much metamorphosis before completion.
' Initially, it ran on five COGs! I thought this was a miracle, since I
' didn't think we'd be able to get such high-res displays on the current
' Propeller chip. It used four COGs to build scan lines, and a fifth COG
' to display them. I kept looking at the problem and realized that it
' all came down to how little monkeying could be done with the data in
' order to display it. The scan line building was reorganized so that a
' single RDLONG picks up four lines worth of pixels for a character, and
' then buffers them within the COG, to later output them with back-to-
' back 'WAITVID color,pixels' and 'SHR pixels,#8' instruction sequences.
' This was so much faster that only two COGs were required for the job!
' They had to be synchronized so that they could step seamlessly into
' eachother's shoes as they traded the tasks of building scan lines and
' then displaying them. Anyway, it all came together nicely.

' Note that the driver has different VGA mode settings which you can de-
' comment and try. Also, the driver contains its own font. You will see
' the character set printed out when you run the program. There are some
' characters within the font that provide quarter-character-cell block
' pixels (for 128x64 characters, you can get 256x128 'pixels'). They can
' be used for graphing or crude picture drawing, where text can be inter-
' mingled.
'
' If you have a 15" LCD monitor, you must see the 1024x768 mode on it.
' At least on my little Acer AL1511 monitor, every pixel locks perfectly.
