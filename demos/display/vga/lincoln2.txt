Avoid popularity if you would have peace. - Abraham Lincoln 

Ballots are the rightful and peaceful successors to bullets. - Abraham Lincoln 

Books serve to show a man that those original thoughts of his aren't very new at all. - Abe Lincoln

Common looking people are the best in the world: that is the reason the Lord makes so many of them. - Abraham Lincoln

Don't interfere with anything in the Constitution. That must be maintained, for it is the only safeguard of our liberties. - Abraham Lincoln

"He that would make his own liberty secure, must guard even his enemy from oppression; for if he violates this duty, he establishes a precedent which will reach to himself."  --Thomas Paine (1737-1809), conclusion, _Dissertation on First Principles of Government,_1795 

How soon we forget history... Government is not reason. Government is not eloquence. It is force. And, like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master. --George Washington

It will be found an unjust and unwise jealousy to deprive a man of his natural liberty upon the supposition he may abuse it. -- George Washington
