    This object is used to configure the system clock at run-time.

    Normally, clock mode and speed is fixed and set at compile-time with clock setting
    constants such as:

          _clkmode = xtal1 + pll16x   'standard mode and
          _xinfreq = 5_000_000        'frequency (80 MHz)

    However, the Propeller allows clock mode and speed changes at run-time for flexible power
    management.  However, the CLKSET command doesn't accept the same clock setting constants
    used by _CLKMODE, above, but rather takes the specific CLK Register values representing
    the desired mode.

    This object was written for those that would rather use the same clock setting constants
    they are familiar with from the _CLKMODE constant.

PUB SetClock(xinfrequency)
{{
    Set the system clock to mode `mode` and input frequency `xinfrequency`.

    Parameters:

    - `mode` - one of the Clock Mode constants defined in the CON block above,
      such as RCFAST_ or XTAL1_PLL16X.

    - `xinfrequency` - Frequency (in Hz) that external crystal/clock is driving
      into XIN pin.  Use 0 if no external clock source is connected.

    Returns the new clock frequency.

    NOTE: The SetMode method automatically converts the given clock setting constant
    expression to the corresponding CLK Register value (shown in the table), calculates
    and updates the System Clock Frequency value (CLKFREQ) and performs the proper
    stabilization procedure (10 ms delay), as needed, to ensure a stable clock when
    switching from a non-feedback clock source to a feedback-based clock source (like
    crystals and resonators). In addition to the required stabilization procedure noted above
    an additional delay of approximately 75 Âµs occurs while the hardware switches the source.
